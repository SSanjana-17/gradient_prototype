# Gradient AI/ML Community Website - PRD

## Project Overview
Premium, cinematic website for Gradient AI/ML student community at BMSCE Bangalore.

## Original Problem Statement
Build a world-class creative-tech website inspired by Lusion.co with:
- Cinematic hero experience
- Smooth scrolling (Lenis-style)
- Premium dark theme with gradient accents
- WebGL/Three.js visuals
- Space travel animation before footer
- Team page with domain-specific animations

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: React 18 + CRA with Craco
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Animations**: Framer Motion + CSS animations
- **Typography**: Unbounded (headings), Manrope (body), JetBrains Mono (code)

## Color System
- Background: `#030014` (near black)
- Primary: `#ff00ff` (magenta)
- Secondary: `#3b00ff` (electric blue)
- Accent: `#00f0ff` (cyan)

## Implemented Features ✅
1. **Premium Loader** - Animated zigzag logo, progress bar, smooth transition
2. **Hero Section** - Massive gradient text, floating particles, dual CTAs
3. **Floating Dock Navigation** - Bottom-fixed pill-shaped nav with active state
4. **About Section** - Who We Are with animated circular visuals
5. **What We Do** - 6 pillar cards (Workshops, Hackathons, Events, Lectures, Placements, Networking)
6. **Impact Stats** - Animated counters (43+ Events, 3300+ Participants, 200+ Members, ₹5.3L+ Sponsorship)
7. **Timeline Section** - 2022-2025 milestones with scroll-driven animation
8. **Team Preview** - Teaser with team images
9. **Space Travel Section** - CSS-based star field animation
